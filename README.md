# ticketingSystem 
 Michael Talorico 2024
Developed a full-featured Help Desk Ticketing System using PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP, which provides a seamless platform for managing IT support tickets. The system allows users to submit support tickets, view ticket statuses, update ticket status (from 'Open' to 'Closed'), and delete tickets. XAMPP was utilized to configure and run the Apache server for hosting the PHP application, ensuring smooth server-side execution and local development.

Key features include:

Ticket submission with user information, issue category, and detailed description.
Real-time viewing of ticket status and ability to update or close tickets.
Ticket deletion functionality for efficient ticket management.
Data persistence through a MySQL database, with tickets stored and retrieved dynamically.
Use of Apache via XAMPP to manage the backend server, facilitating local testing and deployment of the PHP code.


This project showcases proficiency in backend development, database integration, and using XAMPP to create a local web server environment for handling dynamic, user-generated data. It highlights a strong understanding of web technologies and a practical approach to solving real-world IT support challenges.
